## Getting started
### Prerequisites ðŸ”´
You'll need [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to run.  
You'll need [pyAutoGUI](https://pypi.org/project/PyAutoGUI/), [pyDirectInput](https://pypi.org/project/PyDirectInput/) and [pyGetWindow](https://pypi.org/project/PyGetWindow/) Python libraries.

The images have been taken with a 1920*1080 resolution, so you should use the same resolution to avoid any errors.

### Console LOG ðŸ”´
The "console.bat" displays useful information like how many casts made so far, casts until next repair and successfully completion of steps.

I reccommend using [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) or any of [these](https://www.howtogeek.com/196958/the-3-best-ways-to-make-a-window-always-on-top-on-windows/) methods.  

### Anti-AFK ðŸ”´
The Anti-AFK function will move left and right, so beware not to be standing on a little spot from which you can fall.

### Bait Function ðŸ”´
The bait function equips a bait everytime it expires, and always equips the first bait on the baits menu.  
It doesn't stops automatically whenever you have 0 baits, so be sure to get enough baits to fish for the time you need.

### Key Bindings ðŸ”´
The key bindings in-game are set to default, but you can change them at "config.py" file.  
~~~
E       -> Interact  
A       -> Move left
D       -> Move right
R       -> Repair AND Equip Bait
TAB     -> Inventory  
leftALT -> Lock the camera (free look)  
F3      -> Switch to "fishing stance" (cannot be modified)  
~~~
