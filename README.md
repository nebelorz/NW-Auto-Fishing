## Getting started

### Prerequisites

You'll need Python3 to run.

The images have been taken with a 1920*1080 resolution, so you should use the same resolution to avoid any errors.

The key bindings in-game are set to default, which are the following and the only ones used:
~~~
E       -> Use  
Space   -> Jump  
R       -> Repair  
TAB     -> Inventory  
Enter   -> Opens the chat
F3      -> Switch to "fishing stance"  
leftALT -> Lock the camera (free look)  
~~~

### Set up

Configure the settings at "main.py" and run it
