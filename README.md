## Prerequisites
You'll need [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to run.  
You'll need [pyAutoGUI](https://pypi.org/project/PyAutoGUI/), [pyDirectInput](https://pypi.org/project/PyDirectInput/) and [pyGetWindow](https://pypi.org/project/PyGetWindow/) Python libraries.

The images have been taken on 1920*1080, so you should use the same resolution to avoid any errors.

## How does it work?

### ðŸš€ Get Started
Get your fishing rod, baits and enough repair parts and head to your favorite fishing spot.  
Set up your settings in config.py and run the program!

### ðŸ”´ Console LOG
Launching the program executing "console.py" is highly recommended, as it displays useful information like timestamp, how many loops made so far, casts until next repair and successfully completion or error of steps.
The console will stay always on top of everything else.

### ðŸ”´ Anti-AFK
Will move left and right, back to original position, so beware not to be standing on a little spot from which you can fall.

### ðŸ”´ Bait Usage
Equips a bait everytime it expires, and always equips the first one on the baits menu.  
It stops automatically whenever you run out of baits.

### ðŸ”´ Key Bindings
The key bindings in-game are set to default, you can change them at "config.py" file.
