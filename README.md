## Prerequisites
You'll need [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to run.  
You'll need [pyAutoGUI](https://pypi.org/project/PyAutoGUI/), [pyDirectInput](https://pypi.org/project/PyDirectInput/) and [pyGetWindow](https://pypi.org/project/PyGetWindow/) Python libraries.

The images have been taken on 1920*1080, so you should use the same resolution to avoid any errors.

## How does it work?

### 游릭 Getting Started
Get your fishing rod, baits and enough repair parts and head to your favorite fishing spot.  
Set up your settings in config.py and run the program.

Launching the program ***double clicking "console.py" is highly recommended***, as it displays useful information like timestamp, loops made so far, successfully completion or error of steps etc.
The console will stay always on top of everything else.

**The following points have to be considered in order to understand how all the features work.**

### 游리 Reeling
As the program uses image recognition, keep the images on screen clear to be detected correctly and not trigger any errors.

### 游리 Bait
Equips a bait everytime it expires, and *always equips the first one on the baits menu*.  
It stops automatically when you run out of baits.

### 游리 Anti-AFK
Will move left and right, back to original position, so beware not to be standing on a little spot from which you can fall.

### 游리 Reconnection (BETA)
The reconnection will be checked at the start of the loop, if it's true, the program will recognize in which step it is and then begin to reconnect.

In order to get a succesful reconnection, the program looks for the backpack icon on screen
